Having the CIK number of a company of interest,
one is now able to query the financial data reported by that company,
using the companyconcept path of the SEC API [8] and the following HTTP scheme:
https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyconcept/[CIK]/us-gaap/[Tag].json, where:

CIK is the CIK number of the company,
Tag is a tag from the US-GAAP taxonomy.
The US-GAAP taxonomy is a collection of eXtensible Business Reporting (XBRL) tags used by
companies for labeling financial data and reporting it to the SEC.
